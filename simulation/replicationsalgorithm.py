class ReplicationsAlgorithm:
    """
    Implements an adaptive replication algorithm for selecting the
    appropriate number of simulation replications based on statistical
    precision.

    Uses the "Replications Algorithm" from Hoad, Robinson, & Davies (2010).

    Attributes
    ----------
    alpha : float
        Significance level for confidence interval calculations.
    half_width_precision : float
        The target half width precision for the algorithm (i.e. percentage
        deviation of the confidence interval from the mean).
    initial_replications : int
        Number of initial replications to perform.
    look_ahead : int
        Minimum additional replications to look ahead to assess stability
        of precision. When the number of replications is <= 100, the value
        of look_ahead is used. When they are > 100, then
        look_ahead / 100 * max(n, 100) is used.
    replication_budget : int
        Maximum allowed replications.
    n : int
        Current number of replications performed.

    Notes
    -----
    Class adapted from Monks 2021.
    Implements algorithm from Hoad et al. 2010.
