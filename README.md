## üìå¬†¬†Introduction

This repository provides a template for building discrete-event simulation (DES) models in Python.

üòä **Simple:** Easy-to-follow code structure using [SimPy](https://simpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Implements a simple M/M/s queueing model in which patients arrive, wait to see a nurse, have a consultation with the nurse and then leave. Follows a modular structure: uses object-oriented programming, with the simulation implemented through classes.

‚ôªÔ∏è **Reproducible:** This template is designed to function as a RAP. It adheres to reproducibility recommendations from:

* ["Levels of RAP" framework](https://nhsdigital.github.io/rap-community-of-practice/introduction_to_RAP/levels_of_RAP/) from the NHS RAP Community of Practice.
* Recommendations from [Heather et al. 2025](TODO:ADDLINK) "*On the reproducibility of discrete-event simulation studies in health research: a computational investigation using open models*".

üöÄ **Extendable:** This template adapts from and complements material from Sammi Rosser and Dan Chalk (2024) ["HSMA - the little book of DES"](https://github.com/hsma-programme/hsma6_des_book). The book includes additional advanced features that can be used to extend the model in this template, including.

* Multiple activities
* Branching paths
* Priority-based queueing
* Reneging, blaking and jockeying
* Variable arrival rates
* Appointment booking

‚ú® **Style:** Coding style based on the [Google Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html). Used `flake8` and `pylint` to lint `.py` files, and `pycodestyle` for `.ipynb` files.

<!--TODO: Add links to STARS, relevant publication, and https://github.com/pythonhealthdatascience/rap_des/ -->

## üßê What are we modelling?

A **simulation** is a computer model that mimics a real-world system. It allows us to test different scenarios and see how the system behaves. One of the most common simulation types in healthcare is **DES**.

In DES models, time progresses only when **specific events** happen (e.g., a patient arriving or finishing treatment). Unlike a continuous system where time flows smoothly, DES jumps forward in steps between events. For example, when people (or tasks) arrive, wait for service, get served, and then leave.

One simple example of a DES model is the **M/M/s queueing model**, which is implemented in this template. In a DES model, we use well-known **statistical distributions** to describe the behaviour of real-world processes. In an M/M/s model we use:

* **Poisson distribution** to model patient arrivals - and so, equivalently, use an **exponential distribution** to model the inter-arrival times (time from one arrival to the next)
* **Exponential distribution** to model server times.

These can be referred to as Markovian assumptions (hence "M/M"), and "s" refers to the number of parallel servers available.

For this M/M/s model, you only need three inputs:

1. **Average arrival rate**: How often people typically arrive (e.g. patient arriving to clinic).
2. **Average service duration**: How long it takes to serve one person (e.g. doctor consultation time).
3. **Number of servers**: How many service points are available (e.g. number of doctors).

This model could be applied to a range of contexts, including:

| Queue | Server/Resource |
| - | - |
| Patients in a waiting room | Doctor's consultation
| Patients waiting for an ICU bed | Available ICU beds |
| Prescriptions waiting to be processed | Pharmacists preparing and dispensing medications |

## üõ†Ô∏è Using this template

### Step 1: Create a new repository

1. Click on <kbd>Use this template</kbd>.
2. Provide a name and description for your new project repository.
3. Clone the repository locally: 

```
git clone https://github.com/username/repo
cd repo
```

### Step 2: Set-up the development environment

Use the provided `environment.yaml` file to set up a reproducible Python environment with `conda`:

```
conda env create --file environment.yaml
conda activate
```

Note: The provided environment.yaml file is a snapshot of the environment used when creating the template, including specific package versions. You can update this file if necessary, but be sure to test that everything continues to work as expected after any updates. Also note that some dependencies are not required for modelling, but instead served other purposes, like running `.ipynb` files and linting.

### Step 3: Explore and modify

Review the example DES implementation in `scripts`. Modify and extend the code as needed for your specific use case.

Check you still fulfil the criteria in `docs/nhs_rap.md` and `docs/heather_2025.md`.

A template `README` is provided at the end of this file.

Replace entries in the current `CHANGELOG` with your own, alongside creating **GitHub releases**.

Create your own `CITATION.cff` file using [cff-init](https://citation-file-format.github.io/cff-initializer-javascript/#/).

To run tests, ensure environment is active and located in main directory (i.e. parent of `tests/`) and then run the following command. The tests may take around one minute to run. As they run, you will see '.' if the test passes and 'F' if it fails (e.g. `tests/test_model.py ..F..`). When it finishes, you will see the final result (e.g. `==== 1 failed, 4 passed in 51s ====`)

```
pytest
```

You can lint the `.py` files by running either of this commands from the terminal:

```
flake8 scripts/simulation/model.py
pylint scripts/simulation/model.py
```

The first commands in the `.ipynb` files will lint the notebooks using `pycodestyle` when executed:

```
%load_ext pycodestyle_magic
%pycodestyle_on
```

<br>

## ‚ùì How does the model work?

This section describes the purposes of each class in the simulation.

**Model Run Process:**

1. **Set Parameters:** Create a `Defaults` instance and modify it with desired model parameters.
2. **Initialise Model:** Instantiate `Model` using the parameters. During setup, `Model` creates `Exponential` instances for each distribution.
3. **Run Simulation:** Call `model.run()` to execute the simulation within the SimPy environment, running two processes:

    * `generate_patient_arrivals()` to handle patient creation, then sending them on to `attend_clinic()`.
    * `interval_audit()` to record utilisation and wait times at specified intervals during the simulation.

**Trial Class Usage:**

* **Single Run:** Use `trial.run_single()` to execute a single model run.
* **Multiple Runs:** Use `trial.run_trial()` to perform multiple replications of the model.

## ‚è∞ Run time and machine specification

As this a template, it is not possible to provide an overall run time, as this will vary depending on how the template model is used. However, this information is provided from some example implementations, within the `.ipynb` files in `scripts`. These times were obtained on an Intel Core i7-12700H with 32GB RAM running Ubuntu 24.04.1 Linux.
